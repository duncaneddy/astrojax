# Welcome to AstroJAX!

AstroJAX is a minimal satellite dynamics library written in JAX. It provides functions for simulating both orbital and attitude dynamics of satellites using JAX's primitive to enable automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

It is intended to be lightweight and minimal, providing only the essential functionality needed for basic satellite dynamics simulations. The primary focus is on covering foundational algorithms and models, allowing users to build upon them for more complex applications. It is not intended to be a comprehensive or ultra high-fidelity library, but rather a starting point for those interested in satellite dynamics using JAX.

## Getting Started

To get started with AstroJAX, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install astrojax
```

or with `uv`:

```bash
uv add astrojax
```
